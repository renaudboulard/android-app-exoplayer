# android-app-exoplayer
Android application with Exoplayer library alternative to Android MediaPlayer =>
http://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/

The Android framework provides `MediaPlayer` to quickly play stream and local media. But it is not customisable and this is not the most performance solution.

In this example you will find a implementation of `Exoplayer` in `Service` to stream AAC and MP3 music.
